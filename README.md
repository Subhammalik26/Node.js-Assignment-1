# Node.js-Assignment-1

Created a new project with Node.js.

1. Spin nodejs server on port 3000.

2. Create three pages with route "/", "users", "create".

- On "/" route show greeting text.

- On "create" route show form with "userName" input and submit button. On submit button call POST request to "/add" and store user name in text file.

- On "users" route show all the users which we stored in text file. On first attempt there were no users stored so if there are no users then redirect them to "create" route.
